# RPN Calculator

A calculator for reversed polish notation, using function composition.

This was an exercise of concatenative programming; it only supports integer numbers. It is inspired by http://evincarofautumn.blogspot.mx/2012/02/why-concatenative-programming-matters.html.

For more information see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation.

## Usage

Get the program:

	$ go get github.com/sauerbraten/rpncalc

Now, in your `$GOPATH/bin` there will be the `rpncalc` executable.

### Syntax:

	rpncalc <input>

`<input>` consists of int literals and operators; divided by spaces. Operators currently supported are:

- `+`
- `-`
- `路`
- `/`
- `%`
- `squared`

All operators need 2 arguments in front of it, except for `squared` which only needs one. The 路 one is `Alt Gr` + `,` on Linux.

### Examples:

	$ rpncalc 2 3 +
	5

	$ rpncalc 2 3 + 4 5 + 路
	45

	$ rpncalc 2 3 + 4 5 + 路 20 - 10 / squared 3 %
	1
